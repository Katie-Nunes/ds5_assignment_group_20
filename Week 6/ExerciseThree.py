# First, the model might perform well on training data by memorizing patterns specific to that data,
# but fail to generalize to new, unseen data. A test set provides an unbiased evaluation of the model's true performance. 
# Also, the test set performance metrics (like RÂ², accuracy, or mean IOU) give us a realistic
# expectation of how the model will perform when deployed.
